General
This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement, and supersedes all prior negotiations, understandings or agreements (oral or written), between the parties about the subject matter of this Agreement. No change, consent or waiver under this Agreement will be effective unless in writing and signed by NuoDB and Evaluator. The parties are independent contractors under this Agreement, and nothing herein shall constitute either party as the employer, employee or agent of the other party, or both parties as joint ventures or partners for any purpose. Neither the rights nor the obligations arising under this Agreement are assignable or transferable by Evaluator, and any such attempted assignment or transfer shall be void and without effect. Any breach of this Agreement will cause not only financial damage, but also irreparable harm to NuoDB for which money damages will not be an adequate remedy. Therefore, in addition to NuoDB's other rights and remedies, Evaluator agrees that NuoDB will be entitled to an injunction or similar equitable relief against any breach or threatened breach, without the necessity of proving actual damages or posting any bond. If any provision of this Agreement is determined to be illegal or unenforceable, that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that this Agreement otherwise remains in full force and effect and enforceable. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, without regard to its conflicts of laws provisions.
